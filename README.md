Coding...Hmmm...Sitting here with some Matcha poking around, hoping to find a way to define what a branch is, what a commit is, and exactly how they interact at this point. 
Repository+project/folder name essentially
Branches and Commits are pages that interact with each other within a repository, im not exactly sure how they communicate, or exactly what function the branch serves, or the commits serves but im sure learning is quickly approaching.
Pull requests enable communication with the school/instructor/collaborator in order to create a team support environment,  thats a guess.
